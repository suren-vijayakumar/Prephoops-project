# Prep Hoops Admin App

Prep Hoops Network partnered with Prime Digital Academy for our group's final client project. There were four of us who worked over the course of three weeks on the application. Prep Hoops Network needed an application that would parse the RSS Feeds across their 17 sites so that they could monitor the number of articles being published on each site per day. Their previous solution had been an Excel spreadsheet with macros that were taking far too long to run. Our Prime Academy group was tasked with building an application that could access the desired data over a shorter period of time and display it in a way that was useful to our client. We are proud of the final product that runs the necessary report within seconds. The application is live on Heroku, but requires Prep Hoops login credentials in order to access the application.
